Project 5 will display a list of cities in Madison County Illinois.

When the page is brought up, there will be a list view on the left and a map view on the right.   You can limit the number of cities displayed by entering data in the search box.

If you want to know more information about a city you can click on the marker or the city in the list view.   A link to wikipedia information will be displayed in the pop up info window.
